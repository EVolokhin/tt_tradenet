      Tradenet is exclusively a day trading education operation.
      As such, Tradenet often provides past day trading results.
      Those do not indicate future expectations, results or performance,
      and do not warrant or guarantee similar results by you or another.
      Meir Barak’s and others’ trading successes, along with those of other
      Tradenet mentors and traders who appear on testimonials are abnormal
      and do not represent the outcome for most day traders’ efforts.
      The day trading efforts for the majority of day traders will not be profitable.
      Research indicates that under 10% of day traders succeed consistently.
      Contact us for reference.
